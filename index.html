            <h3>5 Signs You’re Not Ready for a Pet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>You Thought Cats Just Watch Netflix:</strong> 
                    If your idea of owning a cat is sharing snacks while binge-watching TV, you’re in for a surprise. Cats don’t care about your shows—they care about knocking over your popcorn bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>“Daily Walks? I Didn’t Sign Up for This!”:</strong> 
                    Owning a dog isn’t just about Instagram photos. Daily walks mean rain, snow, and the occasional embarrassing poop bag mishap.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>“Do Pets Come with an App?”:</strong> 
                    If you’ve ever caught yourself wondering why your pet doesn’t respond to a push notification, it might be time to rethink your readiness for a real-life, non-digital companion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>"Your Dog’s Fitness Tracker Has Better Stats Than Yours"</strong> 
                    Pets need exercise, and if walking your dog leaves you winded - it's safe to say that you guys don't deserve eachother.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>"Your Budget Doesn’t Include “Chewed Couch Repairs”:</strong> 
                    Owning a pet isn’t cheap. From surprise vet bills to furniture replacements, your wallet will be yelling for help.
                </li>
