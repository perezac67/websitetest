            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 2 years</li>
            <li><strong>Time with Owner:</strong> 1.5 years</li>
            <li><strong>Funny Story Since Living with Owner:</strong> "My humans thought Iâ€™d be a quiet lap cat. Fools. I scream whenever they close a door, open a door, or forget that I exist. Once, during a work Zoom call, I launched myself onto the desk and let out a screech so loud their boss thought the fire alarm was going off. They were not ready for royalty." </li>
