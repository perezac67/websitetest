            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Oliver</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 3 years</li>
            <li><strong>Time with Owner:</strong> 6 months</li>
            <li><strong>Funny Story Since Living with Owner:</strong>"They bought me a fancy bowtie, and I embraced it like the true gentleman I am. But one morning, they tried to take me on a walk without it. The audacity! I stood firm, refusing to move an inch. In their desperation, they tried to bribe me with treats - and get this, a scarf from the laundry. Iâ€™m not a peasant, thank you very much."</li>
